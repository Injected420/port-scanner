# Port Scanner

##### Accepts IP Addresses & Domain Names

## scammer_killer

### This is not to be used on legitmate sites!

A Quick Python program to hate on Scammers
The program is simple. You only need the **scammer_killer.py** file.
Once you have the code, and next time you receive a ***scam*** text, open the URL, copy it. Then open the Dev Console, go to the **Network** tab. If there is nothing there reload the page. Click on the request and copy all the **Request Headers**. That is what you will use as ***data***. Make sure you *convert* the Headers into a **JSON** format, just as I did in the file under **data**.

This program will send requests **extremely** quickly to the site.
